## JC2:MP KillPlayer

Part of the "Add Functionality to the Server Console" project, I am introducing a `kill` command...because why not!

#### Server Console
`kill <playername>`
Ends the life of that player

`kill *`
Ends the lives of everyone on the server

#### In-game

`/kill`
Kills the player that types the command.
